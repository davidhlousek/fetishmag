    <p>The magazine "Fetish" might suggest that it's about fetishes. Most of you probably associate the word "fetish" with some kind of sexual kink. For me, it represents anything that a person does at the expense of their basic needs, which means it can be almost anything we do. I think that's exactly where the magic lies. The magic in the ordinary is the magic of mere interest.</p>
    
    <p>What does <em>Fetish Magazine</em> represent to me? It’s a printed publication, a phenomenon, that provides space to ask the people around you what they enjoy doing, what they like. To ask yourself: What do I enjoy doing? What do I like? What is my fetish?</p>

    <p>The magazine is composed of answers to a simple question: What is our fetish? Someone might answer that it's their lifelong devotion to music, someone else might say they enjoy stargazing, and someone might write an entire article on the topic of fetishes.</p>

    <p>Before I started creating <em>Fetish Magazine</em>, I realized that no one had ever asked me these questions. And that’s why <em>Fetish Magazine</em> exists. That’s why I make <em>Fetish Magazine</em>—because I enjoy making it, because I like it.</p>

    <p>The word <em>fetish</em> often brings to mind something sexual, but for me, it’s much broader. A fetish can be anything that captivates us—something we prioritize over our basic needs, something we love deeply. That’s where the real magic lies: in the ordinary things that excite us.</p>

    <p>My fetish is spending time with the people I love. Whether it's sharing a laugh with friends, those connections are what I cherish most.</p>

    <p><em>Fetish Magazine</em> is about exploring this idea—that a fetish can be anything. So, what’s yours?</p>
    <p><em>ALL articles</em> u can find on my are.na account or you can purchase a printed version by dm on @fetishmagazine_ instagram or on any BrnoGs event in Brno.</p>
